> [Detailed Free Version User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/2162-cm-tooltip-cmtg-free-version-tutorial)

1. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Define your glossary terms under the glossary menu item in the administration interface.  The title of the page should be the term.  The body content should be the definition.
4. Creates a main Glossary page (example "Glossary") with no body content, if you so wish. If you do not create this page then your terms will still be highlighted, but without a central listing page of all your terms.
5. In the plugin's dashboard preferences, enter the main Glossary page's id (optional as above)
6. There are a handful of other optional preferences available in the dashboard.

Note: You must have a call to wp_head() in your template in order for the Tooltip js and css to work properly.  If your theme does not support them you will need to link to these files manually in your theme (not recommended).

= Does my main glossary page need to be titled "Glossary"? =

No. It can be called anything. In fact, you don't even need to have a main Glossary page. The plugin will work regardless of the page title.

= Do I need to manually type in an unordered list of my glossary terms on the Glossary page? =

No. Just leave that page blank. The plugin will automatically create an organized, alphabetically sorted list of all your terms.

= How do I add glossary terms? =

Simply add a term under the 'Glossary' section in the administration interface. Title it with the glossary term you want (ex. "WordPress") and put the term's definition into the body (ex. "A powerful blogging platform for creating websites").

= What if I need to add or change a glossary term? =

Just add it or edit it. The links for your glossary terms are automatically added to your page and post content, so your glossary links will always be up to date across your entire site.


= How do I prevent the glossary from parsing a paragraph? =

Just wrap the paragraph with the shortcode: `[glossary_exclude] paragraph text [/glossary_exclude]`. This gives you full control over which content gets processed.

= How do I define the Glossary link style? =

The plugin includes a set of options to configure Glossary link style. Additionally, you can use `glossaryLink` CSS class for general styling. You can also define `glossaryLinkMain` if you wish to have a different style on the main glossary page.

= Can I customize the tooltip design without coding? =

Yes! The plugin includes multiple customization options in the admin panel. You can adjust colors, fonts, sizes, and positioning without touching any code. For advanced customization, you can modify the `tooltip.css` and `tooltip.js` files.

= How can I customize the glossary index layout in CM Tooltip Glossary for WordPress? =

In the free version of CM Tooltip Glossary, you can choose between a list layout or a tile layout for your glossary index. The Pro+ and Ecommerce editions offer even more flexibility, with 18 different layouts available to display your glossary terms in a way that best matches your website design and user experience.


= How can this glossary improve my site's SEO? =

The plugin creates internal links between your content and glossary terms, improving site structure and user engagement. Each term gets its own page, creating more indexed content. The tooltips increase time on page, and the organized index helps search engines understand your content better.

= Will this plugin slow down my large site? =

No. The plugin is optimized for performance with efficient parsing algorithms and caching systems. For very large glossaries (500+ terms), the Pro version includes additional performance optimizations.

= Does the plugin work with all WordPress themes? =

The plugin works with most properly coded WordPress themes that include `wp_head()` in their templates. For best results, we recommend using one of our tested themes: Genesis Framework, Divi, Avada, Enfold, Ultra, Elementor, Beaver Builder, Visual Composer, or Themify.


= Can I use this with page builders like Elementor or Divi? =

Yes! The plugin is fully compatible with popular page builders including Elementor, Divi, WPBakery, and Oxygen Builder.

Absolutely! The plugin supports UTF-8 and is fully compatible with WPML and other multilingual plugins. The Pro+ and Ecommerce versions include additional multilingual features like Google Translate integration.

= Can I import terms from other sources? =

The free version does not include import functionality. Importing terms via CSV files or from external sources is available in the Pro version and through additional add-ons.

= Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini with CM Tooltip Glossary? =

Integration with AI content tools such as ChatGPT and Gemini is available in the Ecommerce version of the plugin. The free version does not include AI integration.


= How do I control where tooltips appear? =

You can control the location and area where tooltips appear (pages, posts, homepage) through the plugin settings. You can also control if tooltips should appear more than once on the same page.

= Can I add multimedia content to tooltips? =

The free version of CM Tooltip Glossary does not allow embedding multimedia content in tooltips. Audio, video, images, and YouTube/Vimeo tooltips are available in the Ecommerce version for a richer user experience.

= Does it support synonyms and variations? =

CM Tooltip Glossary free version does not include support for synonyms or variations. These features, along with abbreviation support, are available in the Pro version and above for a richer, more comprehensive glossary.

= Is there a setup wizard to help me get started with CM Tooltip Glossary for WordPress? =
